# PHP MVC Framework core files

At the heart of the framework is the MVC pattern, which separates the application logic into three distinct components: the Model, the View, and the Controller. The Model is responsible for managing the data and business logic of the application, the View is responsible for rendering the user interface, and the Controller is responsible for handling user input and managing the interaction between the Model and the View.

One of the key strengths of this framework is its flexibility. It is highly customizable, allowing you to configure it to suit your specific needs and requirements. You can easily extend the framework by creating your own controllers, models, views, and helpers, or by adding third-party plugins and libraries.

We hope that you find it useful and that it helps you to build great applications quickly and easily.
